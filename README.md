This project creates a website that consolidates critic ratings from various sources onto a single page, providing users with an easy-to-navigate platform to evaluate movies based on expert opinions.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and summarize user reviews from platforms like Google Reviews and social media, offering a distilled view of general public sentiment.
It also gives personalized user accounts where individual preferences such as searches, likes, dislikes, and watchlists are stored, enabling the system to recommend movies tailored to each userâ€™s taste.
